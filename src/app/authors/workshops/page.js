          We invite you to submit a proposal for workshops at ASSETS 2023.
          Workshops will bring together attendees with shared interests to meet
          in the context of a focused and interactive discussion. ASSETS
          workshops should include topics relevant to the ASSETS community,
          including design, systems, tools, scientific understanding,
          methodology, or social issues relevant to and including people with
          disabilities or older adults. It may also focus on enabling
          technologies, technology use by people with disabilities, disability
          justice, legal and policy issues, or accessibility in computing
          education. Each workshop should generate ideas that will suggest
          promising directions for future work for the ASSETS community. If you
          are working in an emerging area in accessibility, please consider
          organizing a workshop.
